# SQL Joins - AirBnB Clone (Advanced Database Scripts)

This project is part of the **AirBnB clone backend**.  
The objective is to practice **SQL joins** by writing complex queries to combine data from multiple tables.

---

## üìÇ Files
- **`joins_queries.sql`** ‚Üí Contains the SQL queries for this task.
- **`README.md`** ‚Üí Documentation and explanations of the queries.

---

## üîë Task Objectives
Write queries using different types of SQL joins:

1. **INNER JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.
2. **LEFT JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if:
   - A user has no booking.
   - A booking is not linked to a user.

## üìù Queries

### 1. INNER JOIN - Users and Bookings
Retrieves all bookings and the users who made them.

```sql
SELECT b.id AS booking_id,
       b.property_id,
       b.start_date,
       b.end_date,
       u.id AS user_id,
       u.name AS user_name,
       u.email
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY b.id;
````

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN - Properties and Reviews

Retrieves all properties and their reviews, **including properties with no reviews**.
The results are sorted by `property_id` to ensure consistency.

```sql
SELECT p.id AS property_id,
       p.name AS property_name,
       p.location,
       r.id AS review_id,
       r.rating,
       r.comment
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id
ORDER BY p.id;
```

---

### 3. FULL OUTER JOIN - Users and Bookings

Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if there is no match between them.

#### PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT u.id AS user_id,
       u.name AS user_name,
       b.id AS booking_id,
       b.property_id,
       b.start_date,
       b.end_date
FROM users u
FULL OUTER JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
ORDER BY u.id;
```

#### MySQL (since it does not support FULL OUTER JOIN natively, use UNION):

```sql
SELECT u.id AS user_id,
       u.name AS user_name,
       b.id AS booking_id,
       b.property_id,
       b.start_date,
       b.end_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
UNION
SELECT u.id AS user_id,
       u.name AS user_name,
       b.id AS booking_id,
       b.property_id,
       b.start_date,
       b.end_date
FROM users u
RIGHT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
ORDER BY user_id;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

* The `ORDER BY` clause is added to ensure consistent ordering of results, which is required for automated checks.
* Column names (`name`, `location`, `rating`, etc.) should match your schema. Adjust if needed.
* If you are using **MySQL**, remember that `FULL OUTER JOIN` must be simulated with a `LEFT JOIN` + `RIGHT JOIN` + `UNION`.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Tables (for context)

Typical tables in this project may look like:

* **users** ‚Üí `(id, name, email, created_at, ‚Ä¶)`
* **bookings** ‚Üí `(id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, ‚Ä¶)`
* **properties** ‚Üí `(id, name, location, owner_id, ‚Ä¶)`
* **reviews** ‚Üí `(id, property_id, rating, comment, ‚Ä¶)`

---

## üöÄ Usage

Run the SQL queries in your database environment:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < joins_queries.sql
```

(or for PostgreSQL)

```bash
psql -U postgres -d airbnb_db -f joins_queries.sql
```

---

```

üëâ Do you want me to also include a **sample ER diagram (Users, Bookings, Properties, Reviews)** in the README so it‚Äôs more visual and easier to explain?
